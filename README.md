# Final Project Idea


1. Objective - The objective of my final project is to create an online tea shop where users can see an assortment of teas and tea ware for sale. Users will be able to sign up and log in to their own account which will give them access to their purchase history as well as quick checkout that won't require them to re-enter their credit card or shipping information. Users will also be able to write reviews on teas, rate teas, and gift teas to other users.

2. Users - Users will be tea addicts and enthusiasts like myself.

3. Design - The design will be fairly minimal and uncluttered. Professional, but not too serious to keep it from being fun to look at. Color scheme will be something fairy muted. I will probably go with a white or light grey background with colors being used very selectively. I want the focal point of the pages to be the teas and teaware being displayed.

4. File Structure - root directory will have README.md, package.json, .gitignore and probably a Pocfile and an index.js for Heroku deployment. The src directory will have an index.html as well as all my other html files for different pages. Within src will be another directory for a javascript file and another sass directory for a .scss file. I will use babel, cpx and sass to
compile everything into the 'dist' directory.

5. Data Input Output - The user will be able to input credit card and shipping information that will be stored in a database and will be available the next time they log in.

The user will be able to input text reviews that will end up being displayed on the corresponding tea page. This will only be displayed after I get a chance to read the review and determine if there is any inappropriate content. Users will also be able to rate teas on a scale of one to 10 and that will be displayed at the top of their review.

An average of all reviews will be displayed next to the name of the tea.
